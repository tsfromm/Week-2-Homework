<!-- The differences between the 01-string.html file and the 02-number.html file are that in the browser,
when you click the input box for number, you have the option to toggle between options of numbers to choose
rather than type in a number as you would a textbox, such as in 01-string.html.
As for the outputs, I expected to be able to submit the data I input in either box to achieve a result.
However, there was no result. I was able to type in "blah blah blah" for the text input, and decided to toggle
to -4 for the number input but my interaction capabilities ended there. -->
