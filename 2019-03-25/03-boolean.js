/*The last two lines in the console log of the html page read as
false true
true false
This is because in lines 1 and 5 of the js code, it was established that the variable
booleanFalse would result in false and booleanTrue would result in true in the console log.
This is executed in lines 9 and 10 of the js code and lines 5 and 6 in the html console log.

Add the checked="on" attribute to the input element in html code so that the checkbox is filled when the
browser tab is refreshed. 

In the head of these files:
The meta tag/element indicates the metadata of the html page. In this case, the character set of UTF-8 is specified.
The title tag/element indicates what is read on the tab of the html page/what the title of the page is going to read as.
