/*
Result of change in code:
[ '10♣', '9♣' ]
[ '10♣', '9♣', [ '5♣', '2♣' ] ]      This pushes ['5','2'] as an entire unit into the clubs array
[ '10♣', '9♣', '5♣', '2♣' ]          Whereas this adds the values only into the club array seamlessly
false



Suggest how .push(['5♣', '2♣']) differs from .concat(['5♣', '2♣'])
Explain why I asked you to paste new line after instead of before assignment to clubs2
